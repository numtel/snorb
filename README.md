Goals:
* Terrain building system for city building game
* Complex path/intersection construction
* Procedural buildings

Then:
* Make sandbox server for users to upload building, map, tool creations
* Implement system for making game logic definitions uploadable as well,
    creating a space for many games all with source public.

So, it will be a city-building game, but you have to make the game.
Of course, I've got ideas of how I want to make a game. I think I'm not alone though.
